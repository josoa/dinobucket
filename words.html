			<h3>(transition)</h3>
			<p> 
			I’m still so uncomfortable</br>
			And I think that’s why this works</br>
			</br>
			I was living in shadows</br>
			But you are a spotlight</br>
			Exposing my ugly</br>
			Forcing me out of hiding</br>
			 </br>
			I know there is beauty here </br>
			But my shame keeps me blind </br>
			Keeps me quiet </br>
			Keeps me hungry </br>
			</br>
			Behind a carefully placed curtain </br>
			There is a process </br>
			Which will not be revealed </br>
			Before it is finished </br>
			</br>
			Until that time </br>
			I’m not what I was </br>
			Nor what I will become </br>
			So what am I?

			The mundane details of my days </br>
			And I want to know about yours </br>
			</br>
			Ideas and ponderings </br>
			Curiosities </br>
			Linger at the tip of my tongue </br>
			Awaiting your open ears </br> 
			Your wisdom and wit </br>
			</br>
			The quiet space between </br>
			Once brought on worry </br>
			But now leaves me </br>
			With a full heart </br>
			And a tender smile

			<h3>(morning)</h3>
			<p> 
			I woke up this morning </br>
			With tears already pooling </br> 
			In my tired eyes. </br> 
			The alarm sounded too early. </br> 
			A nightmare plagued my sleep, </br>
			And I wondered how rested I was </br>
			Having woken up so many times. </br> 
			I headed for the bathroom and spent a moment </br>
			Staring into the mirror </br> 
			As if I would find some comfort there. </br> 
			I returned to the bedroom and found that my strength was diminished. </br> 
			The tears escaped and I felt angry and ashamed. </br> 
			I hate mornings like this. </br> 
			But you had a nightmare too, and sleepily </br> beckoned me into your arms. </br> 
			We shared our unpleasantries </br> 
			Allowing them to dissipate into the morning grey. </br> 
			I glanced at the clock. </br> 
			The relief vanished. </br> 
			Late again. </br> 
			New plan. </br> 
			I got ready and climbed back into bed </br>
			Milking you for cuddles before facing the real world. </br> 
			The front door is always a challenge to open. </br> 
			I fussed with it a few second too long, and watched the bus pass by. </br> 
			I felt the passages in my brain constrict as the stress grew more intense. </br> 
			It’s fine. It’s fine. </br> 
			I began to walk, oozing negativity. </br> 
			Then I heard the birds chirp, felt the cool air against my cheeks, and realized my advantage. </br>
			How many people are lucky enough to experience this beauty to start the day? </br> 
			I enjoyed the rest of my walk, caught the next bus, and read an interview with some graphic designers on the ride. </br> 
			I arrived, still a little tense, but less so. </br> 
			(A girl with a pink ukulele at her side has no reason to stress) </br> 
			From a distance, I saw a familiar face, who hollered that my class was cancelled. </br> 
			I sighed and smiled. </br> 
			My stress is as real as my nightmares. </br> 
			And rob me of my waking hours </br> 
			Like the latter robs me of my sleep. </br> 
			Learning not to worry is a trick. </br> 
			But it appears the universe is on my side </br>
			And is quite the patient teacher.

			<h3>(vomit)</h3>
			<p> 
			My eyes are heavy from this long day </br>
			This long week. </br>
			There’s no reason for all the worry that creases my brow. </br>
			I know I make things up to fill the spaces. </br>
			I don’t know how to be still </br>
			To stop fighting </br>
			Even when there’s no opponent, </br>
			I fight. </br>
			I’ll invent one. </br>
			Years ago, they said I had a warrior’s spirit. </br>
			Now, I’m not sure what I have. </br>
			I live inside my head, </br>
			More so than I ever have. </br>
			Day in and out, </br>
			I find myself wandering these dark halls, </br>
			Pulling out the drawers, </br>
			Rummaging through the forgotten contents, </br>
			Trying to forge connections that never were. </br>
			I don’t know where I am </br>
			Or where I’m going. </br>
			Some days, </br>
			That’s alright. </br>
			But most days, </br>
			It’s terribly unsettling </br>
			And I don’t know how to rid myself of that feeling. </br>
			I want to be swept away by the wind. </br>
			I want to see the world, </br>
			Live an anchorless life, </br>
			Laugh at falling leaves and make strangers smile effortlessly. </br>
			But I feel so heavy, </br>
			Like my feet are soaked in concrete, </br>
			Like I’m sinking into the earth. </br>
			I regret so many words these days. </br>
			I think I forgot how to talk to people, </br>
			Or I’m just realizing I never really knew how. </br>
			I’m self-aware like I’ve never been, </br>
			Wondering about everything I do and say, </br>
			What benefit it is to anyone. </br>
			I find myself wanting to be nowhere. </br>
			Yes, I care what others think of me, </br>
			But I believe all of this comes from a place </br>
			Of desperately wanting to be good, </br>
			To do good, </br>
			To leave good behind me. </br>
			I look at my father, </br>
			At the lives he’s touched, </br>
			And I want the same for my life. </br>
			I worry that I don’t understand love, </br>
			How to care for people. </br>
			I wonder if I live based on fear. </br>
			I wonder I wonder I wonder.
