		<p>I'm Ashley. I make stuff and solve problems, usually using things I make. Please enjoy perusing my site and crawling around in my head a little bit. Hopefully, you'll <a href="talk.html">get in touch</a> so I can get to know you, too! </p>
		<p>Oh, hey! I built this website. I really dig the web. It's a fun place to play. I did borrow a bit of code from <a href="http://schier.co/blog/2013/11/16/creating-pure-css-lightboxes-with-the-target-selector.html#_" target="_blank">schier.co</a> for displaying my art and design work (thank you, Gregory). That said, if there's something here you particularly like or think could be better, I would appreciate the feedback! As I learn and grow in my web development skills, my site will evolve, so check back every so often to see what new features I add.</p>
		<p>Safe travels, friend.</p>
