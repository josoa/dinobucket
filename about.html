				<h3>who am i?</h3>
				<p>Hello! I am Ashley, writer, designer, musician, and human extraordinaire. I do what I do to solve problems of all sorts. I love the challenging ones most of all.</p>
				<p>I'm very particular about the pens I use. I still start most projects on paper. I do a lot of planning.</p>
				<p>I moved a lot when I was growing up. I realized people are different everywhere, and if you want to be successful, you have to communicate with them in a way they understand. This was the foundation for my understanding of the importance of knowing your audience.</p>
			
				<h3>how did i get here?</h3>
				<p>When I was just a tot, I realized the power of advertising. It told people what to look like, what to wear, what to drink and eat and play with in order to be <em>cool</em>. And people actually <em>listened</em>!</p>
				<p>When I was in sixth grade, my math teacher had us do a project to practice budgeting. We picked a job, and based on the average salary in our area, we picked a place to live, a car, how to feed ourselves... Somehow (I wish I remembered) I chose <em>Creative Director</em>. The salary was fine, but I was most excited about the job description. By the end of that project, I was hooked.</p>
				<p>In community college, I took my first graphic design class. We watched <em>Helvetica</em>. I went home and watched it again. I still rewatch it. Apparently other students didn't share my enthusiasm for the film, but that, to me, was a good sign.</p>
				<p>So finally, I get to <a href="ewu.edu">Eastern Washington University</a> where I got into the thick of it. Typography, layouts, colors... It was like the universe opened up at my fingertips. I finished my <em>BFA</em> in June of 2016 after a challenging and invigorating year completing a thesis project.</p>
				<p>I've been at <a href="zzoommedia.com">ZZoom Media</a> for the last year building their graphic design department. In three months, I was as busy as they thought I would have been at the end of the year. We hired a junior designer just ten months after I joined the team. More on this in my <label for="3">resume</label>.</p>
			
				<h3>acknowledgements</h3>
				<p>My parents are my biggest role models. My dad is witty, charismatic, and could sell ice to an Eskimo. He passed away September 1, 2018, but his spirit is with me daily. My mom is a powerhouse, a lioness, and the strongest person I've ever met. Both of them are ridiculously intelligent. And engineers. I wouldn't be here today without their genes and their support.</p>
				<p>My friends and professors at Eastern Washington University provided encouragement, advice, and patience as I grew into an upgraded version of myself.</p>
				<p>My wonderful clients present me with fun challenges, let me have a good amount of creative freedom, and keep me on my toes. I wouldn't be a designer without them.</p>
